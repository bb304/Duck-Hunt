# My Duck Hunt Remake
This is my Duck Hunt remake. I loved to play the Wii version of Duck Hunt as a kid so I wanted to try to remake it myself. I worked with different GUI components in Java to make what I remember Duck Hunt as. It was a very simple game with nostalgic colors and one main objective, to shoot the ducks down. I hope you enjoy my Duck Hunt!
